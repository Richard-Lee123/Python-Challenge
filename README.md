# Python-Challenge

In this challenge I was given two datasets to work with: PyBank, and PyPoll. Both of these dataset come as a csv and represents two different dataset. Pybank is the financial records of a company, where PyPoll is the election results of a city. 

### Tools
The data source can be found in the Resource folder for each of the dataset. The tools I will be using to analyze the data is Python. I will import os and csv so that I can open and use the csvfiles. 


### Data

#### PyBank
When I opened PyBank the information presented to me was a Date column and a Profit/Losses column. Using this data I found the Total Months for the dataset, the total amount of money the company has, the average monthly change, and what the greatest increase and decrease in profit was.
